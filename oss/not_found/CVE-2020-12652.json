{"cve":"CVE-2020-12652","description":"The __mptctl_ioctl function in drivers/message/fusion/mptctl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.4.14 allows local users to hold an incorrect lock during the ioctl operation and trigger a race condition, i.e., a &quot;double fetch&quot; vulnerability, aka CID-28d76df18f0a. NOTE: the vendor states &quot;The security impact of this bug is not as bad as it could have been because these operations are all privileged and root already has enormous destructive power.&quot;","fixes":[],"analysis":[]}
