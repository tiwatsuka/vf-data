{"cve":"CVE-2020-5270","description":"In PrestaShop between versions 1.7.6.0 and 1.7.6.5, there is an open redirection when using back parameter. The impacts can be many, and vary from the theft of information and credentials to the redirection to malicious websites containing attacker-controlled content, which in some cases even cause XSS attacks. So even though an open redirection might sound harmless at first, the impacts of it can be severe should it be exploitable. The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.5","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop","affectedVersion":"1.7.6.0","fixVersion":"1.7.6.1","results":[{"score":0.19420636,"message":"minor improvements","hash":"2a6bfb379c78884b88ae053bcb619f08a44c0427"},{"score":0.38775498,"message":"Merge pull request #14945 from dheerajwebkul/1.7.6.x","hash":"712c96a0e38ad89108c6f36b8803d40f4f4c8ccb"},{"score":0.30733836,"message":"Untabify","hash":"552b453b7162cdd62e89e33d8ac9678961f0deb6"},{"score":0.25982505,"message":"Merge pull request #2 from dheerajwebkul/customer-message-mail-typo","hash":"33d2eab160371852f79bf2a3853ae4904cd4e021"},{"score":0.24228945,"message":"Fix bug when getting currency name containing localiazed names","hash":"e767bb7895037f019c4e572fc01befef8c27ddea"},{"score":0.23307271,"message":"Fixed {firstname} typo in order customer comment mail","hash":"e1fdeee4e9b4be318e4cd5f70b6e8756c0f63357"},{"score":0.22705866,"message":"Fix some selectors","hash":"b396ae3fd0cb05e2f61a30b139ff7cccbdf59a53"},{"score":0.21894056,"message":"Simplify code","hash":"d47c6d9a4fb596bfa2d9225e5c732ab69d19a927"},{"score":0.19344695,"message":"Create EntityLinkBuilderInterface to refact a part of the HelperList, implement two interfaces and add tests","hash":"51d68f251bf4f29cb5c5f2fe65b1489d665bfab6"},{"score":0.1742075,"message":"Merge pull request #14620 from Quetzacoalt91/enable-properly-kernel-during-upgrade-from-earlier-major-versions","hash":"0ab553381e5aaff585a81ee810c9b67dcc3f5a51"},{"score":0.17098367,"message":"Fix content of the configuration page","hash":"9c9f8e29cb472ede17c98ddedc843dd7c33f1666"}]}]}
