{"cve":"CVE-2020-11037","description":"In Wagtail before versions 2.7.2 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail s &quot;Privacy&quot; controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. This is understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet. Privacy settings that restrict access to pages/documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability. This has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail","affectedVersion":"v2.7rc2","fixVersion":"v2.7.2","results":[{"score":0.9062675,"message":"Release notes for 2.7.2","hash":"55cb4b8809bae90c26428a6ac8f330230b2e1b04"},{"score":0.3372582,"message":"Apply proper HTML escaping on StreamField block comparisons","hash":"e4c0a9f61cc2ee9a69120f144d51af97114d375a"},{"score":0.1208201,"message":"Dont mark the translatable string None as safe","hash":"60b11467ad06f0ad0d3fe459fe9fb83f21722c75"},{"score":0.07332111,"message":"Fetch new translations from Transifex","hash":"0e40a7707d98cb0e1dd6461fea6822f67a7fedf2"},{"score":0.068323694,"message":"Fill in release date for 2.7","hash":"1914371f4d6411a8b9c1d2d83bc9d5ad6a6afdfe"},{"score":0.06479056,"message":"Fill in release date for 2.7.1","hash":"0b1485fa21ebec5de60cf0a6218fc5067ac9517d"},{"score":0.04967167,"message":"Move all usage of versioned_static to media methods (#5694)","hash":"959d538bda5272edc17e54ef438697a4b7ff974f"},{"score":0.04097091,"message":"Release notes for #5694","hash":"35e7d3d2bbdfbb0d3a95aa7493b085589f167b6b"},{"score":0.0070902826,"message":"Version bump to 2.7 final","hash":"72dcbb674cac38b488de984719cb20a08542eb5f"},{"score":0.005472921,"message":"Version bump to 2.7.1","hash":"8e9cdfcde21a2ddd41e52320fa5ad83352157e2d"},{"score":0.00544834,"message":"Version bump to 2.7.2","hash":"baa4accbd0c2c5bbeab38b9d30341f18e5b3a19a"}]}]}
