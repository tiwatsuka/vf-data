{"cve":"CVE-2020-7350","description":"Rapid7 Metasploit Framework versions before 5.0.85 suffers from an instance of CWE-78: OS Command Injection, wherein the libnotify plugin accepts untrusted user-supplied data via a remote computer s hostname or service name. An attacker can create a specially-crafted hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger a command injection on the operator s terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import command.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus","affectedVersion":"5.0.84","fixVersion":"5.0.85","results":[{"score":0.76024944,"message":"update all ruby deps for 2.6.5","hash":"e1bb8651e60b699dfbbb5cd4520b053e5249e980"},{"score":0.5019316,"message":"disable universal libpcap build","hash":"8d46c677790f21868012af6918a13014a8e6276d"},{"score":0.41615966,"message":"update ruby 2.6.6 and openssl 1.1.1f","hash":"006d9b46b89c6bd35d2d127f2f3f06cb1dceba48"},{"score":1.3969839E-9,"message":"Merge pull request #123 from jmartin-r7/ruby-2-6-6","hash":"65ea07427e063adebf14014a3f97c672d038fecf"},{"score":0.0,"message":"Land #118, disable libpcap universal build on macOS","hash":"4685ce0fd93a329bb123dd7095d3fdd773fb089b"},{"score":-1.4901161E-8,"message":"Land #122, update to Ruby 2.6.5","hash":"aa91f27b703e62c3b69fc871845acece356df3f4"}]}]}
