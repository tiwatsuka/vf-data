{"cve":"CVE-2020-1959","description":"A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Apache Syncope prior to 2.1.6 enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.","fixes":[{"url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope/commit/3edc7490da72fad3bd46a72b5e86227db27c4476","hash":"3edc7490da72fad3bd46a72b5e86227db27c4476","message":"Replacing Hibernate Validator with Apache BVal (#169)"}],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/apache/syncope","affectedVersion":"syncope-2.1.5","fixVersion":"syncope-2.1.6","results":[{"score":0.8046366,"message":"Updating site for release","hash":"ff9819b4ef709841a89c5703ff9ed11acb1fb48f"},{"score":0.28564224,"message":"Running console IT cases by default","hash":"a72c4cb0b13e5eac723c3caa1eae85149c47e65b"},{"score":0.13570072,"message":"SYNCOPE-1511: Enhance audit queries with additional params (#140)","hash":"e4fb0ed33744207f90b7cc0126c58ca7984112df"},{"score":0.13151658,"message":"Replacing Hibernate Validator with Apache BVal (#169)","hash":"3edc7490da72fad3bd46a72b5e86227db27c4476"},{"score":0.12764557,"message":"Adjusting entity validation messages","hash":"32975e21a218490e2aca525850afd826f5b610e1"},{"score":0.12753408,"message":"[SYNCOPE-1511] Enhancements for PostgreSQL JSONB and MySQL JSON","hash":"f320dff58d5f98c60ea6716755d491148eaec372"},{"score":0.12695557,"message":"Fixes Quartz definitions for H2","hash":"830c7b6b178200c312838a941a6ae4a3f903c10a"},{"score":0.12284632,"message":"[SYNCOPE-1501] Doc update","hash":"f5ea01668676e434fe60975c667fd21b1c1be7d8"},{"score":0.122702666,"message":"Updating CHANGES for release","hash":"ca61066eb4433eb632424da1151f48e31be82bff"},{"score":0.12035488,"message":"improved group search in enduser now the filter is really a filter","hash":"cb31787159260636184f608d59d661c0d82bef57"},{"score":0.112901576,"message":"fixed core upgrader: custom pull correlation rule migration now uses custom configuration","hash":"c327fce5e6dc4da384878d10496b12c6d6bc276f"}]}]}
