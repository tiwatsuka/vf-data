{"cve":"CVE-2020-12443","description":"BigBlueButton before 2.2.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files because the presfilename (lowercase) value can be a .pdf filename while the presFilename (mixed case) value has a ../ sequence. This can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a directory traversal to bigbluebutton.properties. NOTE: this issue exists because of an ineffective mitigation to CVE-2020-12112 in which there was an attempted fix within an NGINX configuration file, without considering that the relevant part of NGINX is case-insensitive.","fixes":[{"url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/commit/b21ca8355a57286a1e6df96984b3a4c57679a463","hash":"b21ca8355a57286a1e6df96984b3a4c57679a463","message":"Return 404 error when the file download is not allowed."}],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton","affectedVersion":"v2.2.5","fixVersion":"v2.2.6","results":[{"score":0.8052275,"message":"Return 404 error when the file download is not allowed.","hash":"b21ca8355a57286a1e6df96984b3a4c57679a463"},{"score":0.4594728,"message":" - revert back value for wsUrl","hash":"ac78fd5913ca03ab3d678d9204e01e4e895c3075"},{"score":0.20585112,"message":"Set content-type for presentation download, to prevent vulnerable files from being executed","hash":"79361bd4859145f888a88d59d92b1a83ccc8ab23"},{"score":0.19155253,"message":"Merge pull request #9259 from riadvice/fix-file-download","hash":"db26d517a066f90f614e45eaf0c3e288a6800e05"},{"score":0.14354914,"message":"Merge pull request #9115 from basisbit/patch-3","hash":"6852bcb5ecf12fbbbf5b8106082885f0ccb6b933"},{"score":0.120539345,"message":" Prevent ejected users from rejoining","hash":"c40f1727d31c9aefae70978b8c09e30f4b434f05"},{"score":0.08663276,"message":"add support for upload of .jpeg files (not just .jpg)","hash":"f16772818de4e0eb5d07ed8e09dd8c4f460158af"},{"score":0.0651834,"message":"Update BigBlueButton version to 2.2.6","hash":"0b0e32341ab9f6dfa4d7f83669be794dde8fcb9c"},{"score":0.05484836,"message":" Keep track of banned dial-in callers","hash":"cca49e4546069845c5c7c58057b052a376f81ee5"},{"score":0.038391113,"message":"Update settings.yml","hash":"eccc4dd377ae5127e512979bec131eed34c9c8fa"},{"score":0.033321347,"message":"show ss btn on safari (when selected display warning modal)","hash":"1de9f2bfec3542ebfaa27c9b4a34197dad009721"}]}]}
