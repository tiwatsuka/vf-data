{"cve":"CVE-2020-11052","description":"In Sorcery before 0.15.0, there is a brute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired, protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use permanent account lockout. This has been patched in 0.15.0.","fixes":[{"url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery/commit/0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7","hash":"0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7","message":"Fix brute force vuln due to callbacks not being ran (#235)"}],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery","affectedVersion":"v0.14.0","fixVersion":"v0.15.0","results":[{"score":0.97830445,"message":"Fix brute force vuln due to callbacks not being ran (#235)","hash":"0f116d223826895a73b12492f17486e5d54ab7a7"},{"score":0.1507277,"message":"Add forget_me! and force_forget_me! test cases (#216)","hash":"c30cefa751c364ee20b361eb63a766f782b69e5e"},{"score":0.14834337,"message":"Release 0.15.0","hash":"e81c64c1775ad815ae42c75c4be0af41aed69e87"},{"score":0.14070137,"message":"Fix deprecation warnings in Rails 6 (#209)","hash":"26dd64bad3a56f35425b60e2431c40e9c5bb618a"},{"score":0.12155117,"message":"Use id instead of uid for VK provider (#199)","hash":"8d2d0a59bdeeb207428f9ba3073571f563ed01e6"},{"score":0.10925238,"message":"Add recent changes to changelog","hash":"eee56533d90ec94a509c752f0e9178e7ee6fdd79"},{"score":0.09768866,"message":"Allow for custom providers with multi-word class names.
