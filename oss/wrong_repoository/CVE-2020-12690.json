{"cve":"CVE-2020-12690","description":"An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. The list of roles provided for an OAuth1 access token is silently ignored. Thus, when an access token is used to request a keystone token, the keystone token contains every role assignment the creator had for the project. This results in the provided keystone token having more role assignments than the creator intended, possibly giving unintended escalated access.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient","affectedVersion":"16.0.0","fixVersion":"17.0.0","results":[{"score":0.57784224,"message":"Merge \"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation\"","hash":"9bd1c3d3217b09fa06a6af64c720955bac5ebfdb"},{"score":0.45078513,"message":"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation","hash":"ca1262daeb793b5de1f5a267cf03d5b76651dbed"},{"score":0.43703425,"message":"Remove six","hash":"c4c44bcb2df01b77089139b267b1219008f9421e"},{"score":0.3736558,"message":"Random cleanups","hash":"b9a7e03074cbaacc3f270b2b8228a5b85350a2de"},{"score":0.36742195,"message":"doc: Fix supported version descriptions","hash":"ed98fdba412593ff3374e97327f40260d79f76bd"},{"score":0.31188232,"message":"Microversion 2.83 - Add more filters for the nova list command","hash":"9ee74d3ac6d26018d0161e24fe8c0f3f29b21c06"},{"score":0.2136307,"message":"Switch to Ussuri jobs","hash":"cd9958bdb0748aab493fefbf2818ee0d71d8c172"},{"score":0.2043786,"message":"trivial: Remove u prefix from string","hash":"0f7d723c462ab0c083120f811fba682057f2b081"},{"score":0.1753476,"message":"Microversion 2.87 - Stable device boot from volume rescue","hash":"7ed265bbf580cb35876738f16b1d430efd75aa2a"},{"score":0.15404715,"message":"Merge \"[Trivial] FUP: Enhanced description for server list --config-drive help\"","hash":"0150204689db0e2060ebdb5fdbb3f850d1fb98cb"},{"score":0.15360926,"message":"Stop supporting and testing python2","hash":"baccd5bcfa316cec04908e21d5fd95ef52edccfe"}]}]}
