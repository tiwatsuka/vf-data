{"cve":"CVE-2020-10663","description":"The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/alrusdi/jquery-plugin-query-object","affectedVersion":"2.2.0","fixVersion":"2.2.2","results":[{"score":0.94954824,"message":"Version bump","hash":"58fdbb09c962a73ef9acc31ae428187d3661605c"},{"score":0.9370108,"message":"Version bump","hash":"9a517cf2d0bd221868fc20c7a094ea7c560a5217"},{"score":0.032708112,"message":"Fix to support string values with leading 0","hash":"a7c9ac6b77151d361a5620cb1bac959cdac2ca82"},{"score":0.024303844,"message":"Fixed: removing key by value with numeric value","hash":"6856a257899c920a7fccc9beec4b0ce2f9e14e03"},{"score":-1.9208528E-9,"message":"Merge pull request #7 from sanex3339/master","hash":"aabdc6595204eefd9035752d05c6ae349413b288"}]}]}
