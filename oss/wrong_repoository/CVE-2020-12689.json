{"cve":"CVE-2020-12689","description":"An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any user authenticated within a limited scope (trust/oauth/application credential) can create an EC2 credential with an escalated permission, such as obtaining admin while the user is on a limited viewer role. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient","affectedVersion":"16.0.0","fixVersion":"17.0.0","results":[{"score":0.69287956,"message":"Microversion 2.83 - Add more filters for the nova list command","hash":"9ee74d3ac6d26018d0161e24fe8c0f3f29b21c06"},{"score":0.62446046,"message":"Dont print user_data for nova show","hash":"03dca4bc823c82054869dfaf6925d5e1e068ac51"},{"score":0.22070426,"message":"Make server list --config-drive a boolean option","hash":"ea092b29880e71f0ba2d8e1eb93a9cf73edee2a2"},{"score":0.21616028,"message":"[Trivial] FUP: Enhanced description for server list --config-drive help","hash":"3ae6ecc9c051d6541a39e1b6de74039a951a4dca"},{"score":0.17668575,"message":"Merge \"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation\"","hash":"9bd1c3d3217b09fa06a6af64c720955bac5ebfdb"},{"score":0.16591431,"message":"Remove six","hash":"c4c44bcb2df01b77089139b267b1219008f9421e"},{"score":0.1378357,"message":"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation","hash":"ca1262daeb793b5de1f5a267cf03d5b76651dbed"},{"score":0.116095304,"message":"doc: Fix supported version descriptions","hash":"ed98fdba412593ff3374e97327f40260d79f76bd"},{"score":0.09891657,"message":"trivial: Remove u prefix from string","hash":"0f7d723c462ab0c083120f811fba682057f2b081"},{"score":0.09154677,"message":"Random cleanups","hash":"b9a7e03074cbaacc3f270b2b8228a5b85350a2de"},{"score":0.06532145,"message":"Switch to Ussuri jobs","hash":"cd9958bdb0748aab493fefbf2818ee0d71d8c172"}]}]}
