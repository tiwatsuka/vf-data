{"cve":"CVE-2020-12691","description":"An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. Any authenticated user can create an EC2 credential for themselves for a project that they have a specified role on, and then perform an update to the credential user and project, allowing them to masquerade as another user. This potentially allows a malicious user to act as the admin on a project another user has the admin role on, which can effectively grant that user global admin privileges.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient","affectedVersion":"16.0.0","fixVersion":"17.0.0","results":[{"score":0.6788953,"message":"Microversion 2.83 - Add more filters for the nova list command","hash":"9ee74d3ac6d26018d0161e24fe8c0f3f29b21c06"},{"score":0.6157741,"message":"Dont print user_data for nova show","hash":"03dca4bc823c82054869dfaf6925d5e1e068ac51"},{"score":0.20756239,"message":"Make server list --config-drive a boolean option","hash":"ea092b29880e71f0ba2d8e1eb93a9cf73edee2a2"},{"score":0.19980706,"message":"Remove six","hash":"c4c44bcb2df01b77089139b267b1219008f9421e"},{"score":0.19735584,"message":"Merge \"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation\"","hash":"9bd1c3d3217b09fa06a6af64c720955bac5ebfdb"},{"score":0.18108636,"message":"[Trivial] FUP: Enhanced description for server list --config-drive help","hash":"3ae6ecc9c051d6541a39e1b6de74039a951a4dca"},{"score":0.15396081,"message":"Microversion 2.86 - Extra spec validation","hash":"ca1262daeb793b5de1f5a267cf03d5b76651dbed"},{"score":0.15338293,"message":"Random cleanups","hash":"b9a7e03074cbaacc3f270b2b8228a5b85350a2de"},{"score":0.1455473,"message":"Update to hacking 3.0","hash":"0722e80886285f7e5630d5d4012c42806ebc53c2"},{"score":0.13258871,"message":"Microversion 2.85: Change volume-update CLI","hash":"4d6c70d25df99a4f28f263cd3160c74ccf1343e3"},{"score":0.12967709,"message":"doc: Fix supported version descriptions","hash":"ed98fdba412593ff3374e97327f40260d79f76bd"}]}]}
