{"cve":"CVE-2020-1752","description":"A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/VincentS/glibc","affectedVersion":"glibc-2.14","fixVersion":"glibc-2.15","results":[{"score":0.6326843,"message":"Fix glob.h header by removing gcc 1.x support","hash":"d48e586806e3a2a676c60b9b1bf321b0d097fab4"},{"score":0.60661,"message":"Fix last checkin","hash":"54b1f8b6bf88e34c55b77b2e4acb00776b4a5783"},{"score":0.40490526,"message":"Generate testrun.sh to use relative directory names.","hash":"84f9ea0f73dbb3946294acf132f03ab437befc73"},{"score":0.26909932,"message":"Typo in last checkin","hash":"09e18697732f90357db0b3241e563a4db8ebfb03"},{"score":0.25424844,"message":"Correctly NUL-terminate link name in sprof","hash":"c9aafacee48275d85d86f25ab4569516f180846a"},{"score":0.24607158,"message":"Check for overflows in expressions","hash":"90bb2039e93c6b7e95531cf9a9dfc23bbb50f860"},{"score":0.20061018,"message":"Fix off-by-one when reading link name in sprof","hash":"10fb0bfab13b7cd6cd9b22c2edced0fd3a3b8b32"},{"score":0.19904415,"message":"rtld, i386: Fix cfi directive in audit trampoline code","hash":"fbeb5f4db12dccb985ee10eb87fe00b46562b796"},{"score":0.18674849,"message":"Preliminaries for 2.15 release","hash":"c0da14cdda1fa552262ce3624156194eef43e973"},{"score":0.18445802,"message":"Rewrite local headers check to be more robust and informative.","hash":"ea5ee9f73d7b9d143d04e6b91020fe9dc7b18a40"},{"score":0.18051438,"message":"Start 2.15 development","hash":"e80fab373c5cf01246e6acd302795b13dc50d175"}]}]}
