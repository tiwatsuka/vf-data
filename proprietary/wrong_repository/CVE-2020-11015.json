{"cve":"CVE-2020-11015","description":"A vulnerability has been disclosed in thinx-device-api IoT Device Management Server before version 2.5.0.\nDevice MAC address can be spoofed. This means initial registration requests without UDID and spoofed MAC\naddress may pass to create new UDID with same MAC address. Full impact needs to be reviewed further. Applies\nto all (mostly ESP8266/ESP32) users.\n\nThis has been fixed in firmware version 2.5.0.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng","affectedVersion":"old/v2.4","fixVersion":"old/v2.5","results":[{"score":0.5453101,"message":"Added MAC-layer return value to indicate that a packet transmission was deferred","hash":"e6fceb72009e5e6c93be7eea4dd0260670530705"},{"score":0.5057397,"message":"Added a MAC layer return value that informs the caller that a packet did not receive a MAC layer acknowledgement","hash":"d68af249eca7ce293916867f4fd2cbd02bad6c19"},{"score":0.48556185,"message":"Made debug printfs optional","hash":"bb62749de73ed7b9a065cc8033acde064785f643"},{"score":0.46805534,"message":"If no MAC is defined, create one from the node ID","hash":"eeb25b9667120b7c608fd64394caa9bfeaba8652"},{"score":0.42173514,"message":"Added MAC overwriting/burning capability to the Z1","hash":"6f942f1266eaee3d1507831df9516777106064da"},{"score":0.42105865,"message":"Added MAC overwriting/burning capability to the Z1","hash":"43db4fd10e8cb516aeff8922aef21f5da94574d4"},{"score":0.41258192,"message":"Server address options giving different 6lowpan header compression","hash":"d4f58ca7f07f4a984a05e372e14f688b1fc03c17"},{"score":0.40117508,"message":"Added a configuration option for setting the MAC channel check rate (which must be a power of two).
