{"cve":"CVE-2020-10717","description":"A potential DoS flaw was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon (virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU version &gt;= v5.0. Virtio-fs is meant to share a host file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. If the guest opens the maximum number of file descriptors under the shared directory, a denial of service may occur. This flaw allows a guest user/process to cause this denial of service on the host.","fixes":[],"analysis":[{"url":"https://github.com/panda-re/panda","affectedVersion":"lava_5","fixVersion":"r-18-06","results":[{"score":0.48629507,"message":"Added snapshot ability for run_debian","hash":"424e828caa904c4aa9780dfd8913a1f7f0d5c661"},{"score":0.32367527,"message":"some factoring so that I can call something like run_debian from another script","hash":"f2afc109ff4b6d48f8ba9e94b6c94bff803fa2fd"},{"score":0.26656118,"message":"- syscalls2 Makefile compiles the info dynamic libraries. - syscalls2 Makefile uses wildcards to collect switch filenames. - panda.mak now has a compiling dso_* files.
